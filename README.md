#htmlDE

This project is work in progress.

htmlDE is a program that allows you to easily create custom desktop environments in html, CSS and javascript.

htmlDE supports creating both background windows and panels.
Transparent window backgrounds (which you can click through) are also supported.

htmlDE plans on offering a wide variety of plugins, to access the system.
Currently only a plugin to run system commands exists, but plugins for working with virtual desktops, taskbars, system trays and more are planned.
